# Terraform AWS ALB & ASG

This repository contains Terraform configurations to deploy an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** in AWS. The setup ensures high availability and scalability of EC2 instances behind a load balancer.

## Features
- üöÄ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with listener and target group.
- üèóÔ∏è **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** with EC2 instances.
- üìù **Automated index.html update script** on EC2 instances within the ASG.
- üì¢ **SNS Notifications** for Auto Scaling events.
- üîê **Security Groups** for controlled access.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Terraform remote backend (S3)** for state management.

‚ö†Ô∏è Example `.tfvars` files are included for reference, but exposing these files publicly is highly discouraged as they may contain sensitive configuration values.

## Prerequisites
